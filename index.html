                    <p>Who am I? I'm just a guy who loves computers and electronics. I've worked in the IT space for many years, and have discovered a passion for software engineering. I've spent the better part of a year fully immersing myself in the pursuit of growing my developer skills. I moved to the Silicon Valley to participate in a coding bootcamp, am currently attending a coding school there and I've completed dozens of hands-on trainings on serveral programming languages and software stacks.</p>

                    <p>Even with a college degree in hand, I decided to further my education by moving to California and enrolling at a coding school in the Silicon Valley. Although school keeps me plenty busy, I've spent any downtime I find taking online courses to further my knowledge.</p>
